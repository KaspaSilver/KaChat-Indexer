# Kasia Messenger Indexer

A lightweight, specialized indexer for the Kasia messenger application built on Kaspa BlockDAG. This indexer only processes and stores messaging-related transaction data, making it highly efficient and resource-optimized for messenger-specific use cases.

## ⚠️ Development Status

**This project is currently in active development and is NOT ready for production use.**

## Features

- **Real-time BlockDAG Indexing**: Efficiently processes Kaspa blocks and transactions
- **Scalable Architecture**: Modular design with separate processing pipelines
- **Gap Detection & Recovery**: Automatic handling of missing blocks and chain reorganizations
- **Metrics & Monitoring**: Built-in metrics collection for operational visibility

## Architecture

The indexer consists of several key components:

### Core Modules

- **Block Processor**: Extracts and parses encrypted messages from transaction data
- **Virtual Chain Processor**: Handles Virtual Chain Changed (VCC) notifications and transaction acceptance
- **Periodic Processor**: Manages resolution of unknown transactions and DAA scores
- **Historical Syncer**: Syncs historical blockchain data from a specified starting point
- **Chain Subscriber**: Real-time subscription to new blocks and chain updates

### Database Organization

- **Headers**: Block compact headers and gap tracking
- **Messages**: Protocol message storage (handshakes, payments, contextual messages)
- **Processing**: Transaction processing state and resolution workflows

### Message Types

- **Handshakes**: Initial connection establishment between parties
- **Payments**: Payment transactions with optional attached messages
- **Contextual Messages**: Application-specific encrypted messages

Useful commands:

- run locally: `RUST_LOG=info cargo run -r -p indexer`
- build docker image `docker build -t kkluster/kasia-indexer .`
- run as docker-compose: `docker compose up -d`
